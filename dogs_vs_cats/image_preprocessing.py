Data preprocessing
As you know by now, data should be formatted into appropriately preprocessed floating- point tensors before being fed into the network. Currently, the data sits on a drive as JPEG files, so the steps for getting it into the network are roughly as follows:
    1 Read the picture files.
    2 Decode the JPEG content to RGB grids of pixels.
    3 Convert these into floating-point tensors.
    4 Rescale the pixel values (between 0 and 255) to the [0, 1] interval (as you know,
    neural networks prefer to deal with small input values).
