 Adjust the number of units in each recurrent layer in the stacked setup. The current choices are largely arbitrary and thus probably suboptimal.
 Adjust the learning rate used by the RMSprop optimizer.
 Try using LSTM layers instead of GRU layers.
 Try using a bigger densely connected regressor on top of the recurrent layers:
that is, a bigger Dense layer or even a stack of Dense layers.
 Don’t forget to eventually run the best-performing models (in terms of valida-
tion MAE) on the test set! Otherwise, you’ll develop architectures that are over- fitting to the validation set.
