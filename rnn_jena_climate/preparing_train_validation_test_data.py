Now, letâ€™s use the abstract generator function to instantiate three generators: one for training, one for validation, and one for testing. Each will look at different temporal segments of the original data: the training generator looks at the first 200,000 time- steps, the validation generator looks at the following 100,000, and the test generator looks at the remainder.
