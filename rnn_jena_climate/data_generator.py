"""
Generator yielding timeseries samples and their targets

 data—The original array of floating-point data, which you normalized in listing 6.32.
 lookback—How many timesteps back the input data should go.
 delay—How many timesteps in the future the target should be.
 min_index and max_index—Indices in the data array that delimit which time-
steps to draw from. This is useful for keeping a segment of the data for valida-
tion and another for testing.
 shuffle—Whether to shuffle the samples or draw them in chronological order.
 batch_size—The number of samples per batch.
 step—The period, in timesteps, at which you sample data. You’ll set it to 6 in
order to draw one data point every hour.
